# SNES-SuperFX-adapter
A simple PCB adapter that allows the use of a M29F032, AM29F032/29F016 or MBM29F033 (or other pin compatible) flash memory to make a reproduction of a SNES game that uses the SuperFX (GSU-1 or GSU-2) or CX4 cartridge type. No manual wires or hot glue!


Included is the Gerber files, which are needed for a PCB manufacturer to actually make the boards. The PDF instructions on how to assemble are included as well.


These boards require castellation, a PCB manufacturing process that uses "half-vias" on the board edges, to ensure easy soldering to the donor cartridge. Check with your PCB manufacturer to make sure they support this feature (most do, at a slightly higher cost).
